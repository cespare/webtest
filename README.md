# webtest

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cespare/webtest.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cespare/webtest)

This package contains a testing DSL originally extracted from an internal
package in [golang.org/x/website][xwebsite], the website code that powers
go.dev. This package is distributed under the same license as the original.

Since forking, this version has been slightly cleaned up and tagged for public
consumption. We've also added a few extra features.

(The idea for this comes from https://github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal.)
