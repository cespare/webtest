# webtest

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cespare/webtest.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cespare/webtest)

This package contains a testing DSL extracted from [the website code that powers
go.dev][xwebsite].

That package is internal. This copy has been slightly cleaned up and tagged for
public consumption. It is distributed under the same license.

(The idea for this comes from https://github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal.)
